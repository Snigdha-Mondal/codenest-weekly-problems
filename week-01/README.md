Week-1 Codenest Coding Challenge

To find the only missing number in the range of numbers given, first the length of the range of numbers is found (n). Then we use that n to find the sum of that range of numbers. After that we find the actual sum of the numbers provided by the user and subtract the actual sum from the original sum of the numbers to find the missing number.

Time complexity- O(n)
because we have to traverse over all the elements in the given range of numbers to find the actual sum
