Codenest week-03 weekly challenge.

To find the number of even and odd elements in an array,we first input the length and the elements in the array. Then we check each element of the array if they are even or not. After that, we simply subtract the number of even elements from the total length of the array. Then we print the number of even and odd elements seperately.
